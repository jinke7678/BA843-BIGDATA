## Executive Summary

Our project aims to utilize a comprehensive dataset containing flight delay and cancellation information from US commercial airlines to address several critical objectives. Firstly, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of delays over time, examining specific patterns related to airlines or airports. By analyzing historical data, we intend to uncover recurring trends and seasonal variations, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing flight schedules and punctuality.

Secondly, we will delve into the root causes of flight delays, identifying primary factors contributing to disruptions and assessing how these trends evolve over time. Through meticulous examination and advanced analytics techniques, we seek to gain insights into the leading reasons for delays, including inclement weather, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues, and crew scheduling constraints.

Lastly, we aim to develop predictive models capable of forecasting future flight cancellations or delays, along with estimating the approximate duration of these disruptions. Leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, our goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for proactive planning and risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, we intend to offer passengers optimal travel time recommendations based on our analysis, enabling them to make informed decisions and minimize the impact of disruptions on their travel plans.

In summary, our project endeavors to harness data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency, improve passenger experience, and mitigate economic losses associated with flight disruptions. By comprehensively analyzing flight delay and cancellation data, we aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations that benefit both airlines and passengers, ultimately contributing to smoother and more reliable air travel experiences.
